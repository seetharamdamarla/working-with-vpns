VPN Encryption and Privacy Features

1. VPN Encryption
VPN encryption is the process of converting your internet traffic into unreadable code to prevent unauthorized access.

Common VPN Encryption Protocols:
- AES-256 (Advanced Encryption Standard)
  - Industry-standard encryption used by most VPNs.
  - Extremely secure and resistant to brute-force attacks.

- RSA Encryption
  - Used for secure key exchange between your device and the VPN server.

- Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS)
  - Changes encryption keys regularly to ensure past sessions cannot be decrypted if current keys are compromised.

2. VPN Privacy Features
VPNs offer several privacy-enhancing tools that help protect user data and online identity.

Key Privacy Features:
- IP Address Masking
  - Hides your real IP address and shows the VPN serverâ€™s IP, making you anonymous to websites.

- No-Logs Policy
  - Good VPN providers do not store browsing history, connection timestamps, or IP addresses.

- Kill Switch
  - Automatically disconnects your internet if the VPN connection drops to prevent data leaks.

- DNS Leak Protection
  - Ensures your DNS queries are routed through the VPN, not your ISP, to prevent location exposure.

- Split Tunneling
  - Allows you to choose which apps use the VPN connection and which can bypass it.

3. VPN Protocols Overview

| Protocol      | Speed      | Security   | Common Use                  |
|---------------|------------|------------|-----------------------------|
| OpenVPN       | Medium     | High       | General secure browsing     |
| IKEv2/IPSec   | Fast       | High       | Mobile stability            |
| WireGuard     | Very Fast  | High       | Modern VPNs, fast streaming |
| PPTP          | Fast       | Low        | Outdated, not recommended   |

Summary:
- VPNs encrypt traffic to ensure secure communication.
- They hide IP addresses to protect online identity.
- Additional privacy features like kill switch, DNS leak protection, and no-logs policies enhance user security.
- Modern protocols (OpenVPN, WireGuard) provide the best balance of speed and security.
