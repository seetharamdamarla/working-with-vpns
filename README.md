# 🚀 Task 8: VPN Setup and Traffic Encryption Verification

----

## 📚 Objective:
The goal of this task is to understand the role of VPNs in protecting privacy and ensuring secure communication. The task involved setting up a VPN, verifying its functionality, analyzing traffic encryption, and comparing network performance with and without VPN.

## 🛠️ Steps Performed:

## 1. ✅ VPN Setup:

- Installed ProtonVPN (Free Tier) on my system.
- Connected to a VPN server located in the USA.


## 2. 🌍 IP Address Verification:
   
- Checked my IP address before VPN connection using whatismyipaddress.com and took a screenshot.
- Verified the IP address after VPN connection and confirmed that it changed to the VPN server’s IP. Screenshot was taken.

## 3. 🔒 Traffic Encryption Confirmation:
   
- Browsed popular websites like cnn.com and nytimes.com to ensure encrypted traffic.
- Verified that the traffic was using HTTPS protocol by observing the browser URL and traffic in Wireshark.
- Detected QUIC protocol packets in Wireshark, confirming encrypted and secure connections.
- Relevant screenshots were captured.

## 4. 📶 Browsing Speed Comparison:
   
- Conducted a speed test using fast.com while connected to VPN.
  Speed: 220 kbps

- Disconnected the VPN and conducted the speed test again.
  Speed: 300 kbps

- Confirmed that VPN slightly reduced the browsing speed due to encryption overhead.

## 5. 📝 Research on VPN Encryption and Privacy Features:

- Detailed research was conducted and summarized in a separate document covering:
- VPN encryption standards (AES-256, RSA)
- Privacy features (IP masking, no-logs policy, kill switch, DNS leak protection)
- VPN protocols (OpenVPN, WireGuard, IKEv2)

## 6. 📂 Files in the Repository:

## 📖 VPN Benefits and Limitations:
Detailed documentation on VPN benefits (privacy, encryption, bypassing restrictions) and limitations (reduced speed, blocked sites, trust dependency) provided in the repository.

## 🔗 Key Learnings:
- Hands-on VPN setup and connection.
- Traffic encryption analysis using Wireshark.
- Practical understanding of VPN impact on speed and privacy.
- Importance of VPN protocols and privacy features.
  
## ✅ Conclusion:
In this task, I successfully set up and used ProtonVPN 🔐 to protect my online privacy 🌐. I verified that the VPN effectively changed my IP address 🌍 and encrypted my browsing traffic 🔒. The browsing speed 📶 slightly decreased while connected to the VPN, which is expected due to encryption overhead.

Overall, this task provided practical experience 🛠️ in using VPNs for secure and private internet usage.
